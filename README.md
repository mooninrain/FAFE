# FAFE
The official implementation of Frame Aligned Frame Error.

Note: The original FAFE is done on a very heavy codebase of Helixon designed to support fast training of AlphaFold-like models. Unfortunately, we can not release the full version of it because it's widely used in many confidential projects. Instead, we plan to clean the code and release a self-contained version for academic use. Stay tuned!

### Roadmap
1. We have added all the loss terms. (Done)
2. We plan to release pretrained weights compatible with openfold. (Very soon)
3. Release a light-weighted reproducible training script.
